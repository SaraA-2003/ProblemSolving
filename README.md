# ProblemSolving

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of C# programming problems implemented in **Visual Studio**. Each problem is organized into its own folder and focuses on solving a specific algorithmic challenge. This project serves as a growing archive of practice problems.

Each problem folder includes a method that solves the given challenge. The `Program.cs` file contains the `Main` method that executes all problems together. However, each problem can also be run independently from its own folder.

## Implemented Problems

1. **Second Largest Number**  
   Find the second largest number in an array of integers.

2. **Missing Number**  
   Identify the missing number in a sequence from 1 to N using the formula:  
   `Sum = k * (k + 1) / 2`

3. **First Non-Repeated Character**  
   Find the first non-repeated character in a given string.

4. **Sort an Array (without built-in methods)**  
   Sort an array of integers in ascending order using nested loops and manual swapping.

5. **Find Maximum Value**  
   Return the maximum value in a given array of integers.

6. **Count Vowels in a String**  
   Count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) appear in a given string, ignoring spaces and case sensitivity.
