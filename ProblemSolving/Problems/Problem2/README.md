# Problem 2: First Non-Repeated Character

## Overview

This problem focuses on finding the **first non-repeated character** in a string using **C#** and **Visual Studio**. Two solutions are demonstrated:
- A **brute-force approach** using nested loops
- An optimized approach using a **dictionary** to count character frequency

The program also handles edge cases such as an empty string.

## Problem Statement

Given a string, return the **first character** that does **not repeat**.  
If all characters are repeated, return a default value (`'\0'` or `'!'` depending on the method used).

## Solutions

### âœ… Optimized Solution Using Dictionary

This version uses a `Dictionary<char, int>` to count the frequency of each character, then iterates again to find the first with count 1.

#### Code Summary

```csharp
static char nonRepeatedChar(string name)
{
    Dictionary<char, int> dic = new Dictionary<char, int>();

    // First pass: count frequencies
    for (int i = 0; i < name.Length; i++)
    {
        char c = name[i];
        if (dic.ContainsKey(c))
        {
            dic[c]++;
        }
        else
        {
            dic.Add(c, 1);
        }
    }

    // Second pass: find first char with count = 1
    for (int i = 0; i < name.Length; i++)
    {
        char c = name[i];
        if (dic.ContainsKey(c) && dic[c] == 1)
        {
            return c;
        }
    }

    return '\0'; // No unique character found
}
